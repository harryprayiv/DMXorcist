DMXorcist Beta
=========================

Reasons for creating this fork
--------------------
* I adore Haskell
* while I love QLC+, my professional needs from it were too numerous
* no 16-bit Support
* needs an entirely new GUI
* I want to learn the functional paradigm by creating something useful
* QLC5 is 2 years away
* QLC+ Codebase is clean but inhenerently hard to extend due to C++

DEVELOPER AT WORK
------------------

This is a completely new project that is using QLC+ as the inspiration.  I am using Haskell (or whatever I end up using, honestly) because it offers data safety and stability.  I am leaning toward Haskell because I have fallen in love with it lately.  In my research, I am already noticing that not that many packages exist for GUI's in Haskell, so it might have to be a QT5 UI with Haskell bindings.  No problems yet but that doesn't bode well.  


Requirements - Linux
--------------------
* GHC
* stack
* cabal

Disclaimer: I have a tendency to walk away from a project and come back a year later (or never).  That's a huge problem for my resume but I am not really trying to build a resume.  I would like some collaborators on this if anyone wants it to have ANY chance in hell of being good or even remotely finished to some degree.
